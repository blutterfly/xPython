## 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a programming language that is:

+ Easy to learn
+ Powerful and versatile
+ Used in fields like web development, data science, and AI
  
## 2. Setting Up Python
Install Python from python.org.
Use an IDE like 
  + IDLE 
  + VS Code
  + Jupyter Notebook
  + Pycharm 

## 3. Basic Python Syntax
Hello World Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Explanation: print() is a built-in function to display text on the screen.

Exercise:
Write a program to print:

Your name
Your favorite subject

## 4. Variables and Data Types
**Variables**
```python
name = "Alex"
age = 16
is_student = True
print(name, age, is_student)
```

**Explanation:**

Variables store data.
Python determines the data type automatically.
**Data Types**
 + String: "Hello"
 + Integer: 10
 + Float: 3.14
 + Boolean: True or False

**Exercise:**
Create variables to store:

Your age
Your favorite number
Whether you like pizza (True/False)

## 5. Input and Output
Getting User Input
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Explanation: input() gets input from the user.

**Exercise:**
Write a program that:

Asks for the userâ€™s favorite color.
Prints: "Wow, I like [color] too!"

## 6. If Statements (Decision Making)
Example
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```
Explanation:

if checks conditions.
Use int() to convert input to a number.
Exercise:
Write a program that checks:

If a number is even or odd.

## 7. Loops
For Loop
python
Copy code
for i in range(5):
    print("This is loop number", i)
While Loop
python
Copy code
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count is", count)
    count += 1
Exercise:

greet("Alex")
Explanation:

Functions group reusable code.
Exercise:
Write a function that:

Takes two numbers as input.
Returns their sum.
9. Lists and Loops

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
Explanation: Lists are collections of items.
